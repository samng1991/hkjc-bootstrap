Short term things to do:

* Explicit => Explicitly

DONE

* Consolidate mock argument matching and spy argument matching
* Consolidate mock block detection and spy block detection.
* Consolidate the :on option with mocks
* Pass through mode for partial mocks
* Update readme
* auto-mock class when using base_class

IDEAS

spy.should have_received(:foo).with(arg1, arg2)  # PREFERRED
spy.should have_received.foo(arg1, arg2)

assert_called spy, :foo, arg1, arg2
assert_spy(spy).received(:foo).with(arg1, arg2)
